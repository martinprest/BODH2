Number converter for the Psion Organiser

Allows user to convert the base of a number, by choosing between: binary, octal, decimal or hex.

Used floats to increase max number - useful for entering 16-bit numbers.

Created a new user interface.

It's now compatible with either a 2-line or 4-line organiser.

lots of rem statements make it a big file, but just the object could be uploaded, or the rems removed.
